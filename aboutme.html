									<b>Hello, I'm Jessie - it's nice to meet you!
									</b>
									<br/><br/>
									I'm a new graduate from Brandeis International Business School with a master's degree in Business Analytics. 
									My expertise lies in data analysis, project management, and building predictive models using machine learning algorithms in Python.
									<br/>
									Before joining Brandeis University, I earned my bachelor's degree in logistics management at BTBU in Beijing, China, where I received the Outstanding Graduate Award. 
									During my senior year, I participated in an exchange program in Ireland, which gave me the chance to work with advanced statistical modeling techniques and modern analytical tools.

								</p>
								<br/>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/IMG_7784.jpg" height="480" width="370" alt="" /></span>
									I have a passion for problem-solving and a drive for continuous learning and improvement. In my free time, I take online courses to keep up with the latest technology and industry trends. 
									Recently, I passed the AWS ML specialty certificate exam and feel confident in building cloud-based applications in the workplace. I also listen to podcasts about recent industry news.
									<br/><br/>
									With all the tools and techniques I've learned so far, I'm ready to take on more challenging tasks and contribute to the workplace by diving into real-world problems. I enjoy collaborating with others and sharing my ideas and additional resources with the whole team. One of my teammates once told me that she learned a lot from our discussions and appreciated my ability to motivate others. 
									That kind of positive feedback is very rewarding for me.
									<br/><br/>
									Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I look forward to connecting and collaborating with you!
									
									
								</p>
								<h3>Fun Fact: </h3>	
								<p>
									I used to be a press photographer in college, and still keep the habit of using photos and videos to record my life<br/>
								   	
									Want to try skydiving!
